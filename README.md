# Web-Based-GuessTheNumber

This is a simple Guess the number game that can run in your browser or your webpage.
The game generates a number between 1 and a 100 that the player needs to guess.
You can easily modify the range if you want to make it easier or harder. Just remember to also modify it in the Replay function.
You can also modify what it say when the player is close or far from the number as well as what it says when they are getting closer or not.
